# WIFI Password Cracker

**WIFI Password Cracker** is a **BASH** script which can be used for Wireless Penetration Testing: Password Cracking.
The objective of this script is to capture the WPA/WPA2 authentication handshake and then use **Aircrack-ng** to crack the pre-shared key, by deauthenticating an existing wireless client. 

You can take a look at the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/Osama-Yusuf/WIFI-Password-Cracker).
